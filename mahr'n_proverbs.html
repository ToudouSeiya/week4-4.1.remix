Morgan Lincicum
These generative phrases are inspired by a fictional world that
I like to write/draw/talk about that I've had in my head for
many years. I used names of cities, factions, etc. in place of
those that were already here, and modified, removed, and added 
some possible phrases to fit the general vibe.

Some favorites: "All roads lead ever on."
"Right or wrong, to the stars."
"The sun never sets in the void."
"No man is my country."
"Say yes to fish!"
